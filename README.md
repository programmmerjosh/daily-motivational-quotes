# Daily Motivational Quotes

### This will be a React App that will serve a similar function to an API

We do NOT need an API that will be able to be pinged multiple times from different devices/applications AND
we do NOT need a flexible database of information coming in and going out all the time.

All we need to do here is:

1. Have a single JSON file with our data
2. Have a timer running constantly (to check when date has changed), OR an event handler that can trigger on date-time changes
3. GET data from our JSON file on date-time change
4. POST data to an actual API
