            "To laugh is to risk appearing a fool,\nTo weep is to risk appearing sentimental.\n\nTo reach out to another is to risk involvement,\nTo expose feelings is to risk exposing\nyour true self.\n\nTo place your ideas and dreams\nbefore a crowd is to risk their loss.\n\nTo love is to risk not being loved in return,\nTo hope is to risk despair,\nTo try is to risk to failure.\n\nBut risks must be taken because\nthe greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.\n\nThe person who risks nothing, does nothing,\nhas nothing is nothing.\n\nHe may avoid suffering and sorrow,\nBut he cannot learn, feel, change, grow or live.\n\nChained by his servitude he is a slave\nwho has forfeited all freedom.\n\nOnly a person who risks is free.",
